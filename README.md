# Lego_Pinball_Script


Lego pinball machine consists of a Servo blocking a path for the ball to go to trigger a homemade(aluminum foil) sensor, a matrix as score display, and LEDs to illuminate the paths that the ball pass. Ball = Marble. A4 goes to a seperate device's playback button to play recorded sounds on that device.
